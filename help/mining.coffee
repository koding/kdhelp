CPU Mining is #{c.r}**NOT**#{c.x} allowed on Koding. Doing so will get your account banned,
and inevitably waste your time. Do not mine on Koding.

Now with that out of the way, you may be asking why we don't allow it?

We are giving you free resources on Koding because we want to enable
*development* on Koding. Mining and CPU donating are not development.
Furthermore, they consume a disproportionately large amount of
resources. Denying them from your fellow Koders.

This is a free resource that we are offering you. Please don't abuse it.


                  #{c.r}Do not mine on Koding.
