module.exports = """
MongoDB comes preinstalled on Koding VMs and can be logged into with the
following command:

  mongo

For development ease Mongo Auth is disabled by default, so no auth credentials
are required.

As always, additional help can be found on Koding University at:
  http://learn.koding.com

Or from the Koding community, at:
