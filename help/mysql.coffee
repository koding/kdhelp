MySQL comes preinstalled with the Koding VMs, and can be logged into by typing
the following command:

  mysql -uroot

You should note that the `-p` flag is not included in that command. That is
because there is no root user password by default.

When entering MySQL login details into your applications, make sure you log in
from localhost, not your VM Hostname.
